# YouTube Shorts Automater

The Creator Growth Control Plane YouTube flow uses AI generated images as the visuals for the video, instead of using stock footage. This makes the videos more unique and less likely to be flagged by YouTube. It also supports music right from the get-go.

## Relevant Configuration

In your `config.json`, you need the following attributes filled out, so that the bot can function correctly.

  "llm": "The Large Language Model you want to use to generate the video script.",
  "image_model": "What AI Model you want to use to generate images.",
  "threads": 4,
  "is_for_kids": true
}
```
